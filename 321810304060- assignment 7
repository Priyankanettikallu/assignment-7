1)Generate first N number of Fibonacci numbers. Take N value from 

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0
if nterms <= 0:
   print("Please enter a positive integer")
elif nterms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
   print(n1)
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < nterms:
       print(n1)
       nth = n1 + n2
       # update values
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1
       
#output:-How many terms? 7
#Fibonacci sequence:
#0
#1
#1
#2
#3
#5
#8

2)Take 10 integers from keyboard using loop and print their average value on the screen 

print("Input some integers to calculate their average. Input 0 to exit.")
count = 0
sum = 0.0
number=1
while number !=0:
	number = int(input(""))
	sum = sum + number
	count += 1
if count == 0:
	print("Input some numbers")
else:
	print("Average of the above numbers are: ", sum / (count-1))
	
#output:-Input some integers to calculate their average.input 0 to exit.
#2
#3
#4
#5
#6
#7
#8
#9
#4
#5
#0
#Average of above numbers are:5.3
	 
3 )Print the   following patterns using loop : 
#     * 
#     ** 
#     *** 
#     **** 

i = 1
while i<=4:
  print ("*"*i)
  i = i+1
  
#output:-
#     * 
#     ** 
#     *** 
#     **** 

4)Write a program to find the length of the string "refrigerator" without using len( ) function. 

a = "refrigerator"
count = 0
for i in a:
  count = count+1
print (count)

#output:-12

5) Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.

def char_frequency(str1):
    dict = {}
    for n in str1:
        keys = dict.keys()
        if n in keys:
            dict[n] += 1
        else:
            dict[n] = 1
    return dict
print(char_frequency('google.com'))

#output:-{'o': 3, '.': 1, 'g': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, 'c': 1, 'm': 1}

6)Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases

user_input = input("What's your favourite language:")
print("My favourite language is ", user_input.upper())
print("My favourite language is ", user_input.lower())

#output:-What's your favourite language:english                                                                       
#My favourite language is  ENGLISH                                                                             
#My favourite language is  english 

7) Write a Python program to count occurrences of a substring in a string.

str1 = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'
print()
print(str1.count('fox'))

#output:-1
